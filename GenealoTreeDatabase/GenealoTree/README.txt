--GeneaoloTree--
The goal of this project is to create a tool that lets the user see the details of a person and their relationships with other people on a family tree. 
The importance of this software is that a user will be able to track their heritage and traditions, as well as medical histories across generations of their family tree.
-Design-
There are three main views in the software. First, there is an Add/Modify view where the user can add or edity information for people already on the family tree. This is a data entry form. Second is the Relationship view. Here, the user can see a "tree" with the names and pictures of people added to the tree. Lines are connecting parents/children and person/spouse. Users can view both the selected person's ancestors and descendants at once in the relationship view. Finally, there is the Individual view where the user can see all information entered for a person. For consistency, the Individual view looks similar to the Add/Modify view, but it cannot be modified.
-Tech Used-
Built using Visual Studio in C#.
-How to Use-
Run the executable (GenealoTree.exe) in the debug folder. When the desktop app launches, the home screen appears. Click on "Add New Family Member" and you will be redirected to the Add/Modify form which you can then fill out. For dates, if you know the date, check the appropriate checkbox and a date/time selection will appear. For any information you don't know, leave it blank. If there are things you are uncertain about, add it to the notes or questions section. Be sure to click "Save". 
Note, when entering information avoid using the comma "," as it acts as the delimiter in the created person files.
Click on View Relationships button to view your "tree". The selected person is outlined in yellow and their parents, children, and spouses will be visible. You can click "select" beneath any person and the app will switch the person you are viewing so you can see that person parents/children/spouses. Or clicking on "Details" will send you to that person's Individual view. This view has an "Edit" button that will bring you to the Add/Modify view. Every view also has a "Home" button in the bottom left corner to go back whenever needed.
